# Exam Registration System for Students (back-end)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uni-ruse-software-engineering-2017/exam-registration-backend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uni-ruse-software-engineering-2017/exam-registration-backend)

This is a [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) project which exposes a RESTful API.

## Dependencies

You must install the following in order to run and contribute to the project:

1.  [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2.  [Java 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
3.  [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
4.  [PostgreSQL 10.0+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
5.  Eclipse or other Java IDE

You should also install a REST client for easier interacting with the server. You can use either of these:

1.  [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
2.  [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
3.  Chrome or Firefox REST client extensions

## How to run

You should have JDK 1.8, Maven and Postgre configured properly. PostgreSQL must be running as a service.

You can run the server via the command line:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or you can start it from your IDE of choice.
